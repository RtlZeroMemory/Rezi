# Roadmap

This roadmap is directional and may change; releases are driven by shipped, tested behavior.

## Near term (alpha)

- Stabilize remaining edge cases in createApp lifecycle
- Performance optimization (frame coalescing, allocation reduction)
- Expand example applications

## Medium term (beta)

- Widget composition API hardening (defineWidget)
- Additional recipes and patterns documentation
- CI benchmark regression tracking
- Plugin/extension system

## Longer term (stable)

- Alternative runtime backends (Bun, Deno) via @rezi-ui/core portability
- Additional platform features as Zireael evolves
- Accessibility improvements
- Community widget ecosystem
